Execute 'Stitching.py'. In the OpenCV window press 's' to select if the match is correct, 'r' if the match is incorrect, press 'q' to quit after selecting 10 matches for better results (3 matches is minimum).
Then convert the stitched map into .pgm file by executing 'pgm code.py'.
In order to calculate Computational Latency execute 'CompLatency.py'
